### Tram on rails game


# Background


**Tram on rails** is a 2D game with a top-down view. A tram/cable car will ride on San Francisco Street, trying to avoid collisions with randomly appearing taxi cabs. A tram could go straight/left/right and back. When it honks, taxi cabs will disappear from the screen. There will be an “n” number of honks and an “n” number of possible collisions. A stopwatch starts at the same time a user starts the game. A goal is to avoid obstacles as long as you can. 

### Functionality & MVPs

In the “Tram on rails” game, users will be able to:

- Interact with the website page, click links, mute sound, start and pause the game
- Move a tram/ cable car in all directions on the road in Canvas
- Honk cars to avoid collision and remove objects
- Keep track of the stopwatch and the number of collisions left

In Addition, this project will include:
- Game instruction
- A production README
